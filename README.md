# Learn_Python
Just Learning Python


The folder is about my initial journey in learning one of the best languages: Python. I'm sharing the codes that I've (am)
wrote (writing) to learn Python. I've learned the basic concepts- looping, recursion, conditionals, dictionaries, list, and 2-3 modules- but I've yet to learn any topic in detail. I'll learn that too someday, and maybe post it in some other repository.

At the time of writing this README, I'm just learning how to use GitHub, and I'll use this Source Control platform to upload/share all of the codes that I want to write
